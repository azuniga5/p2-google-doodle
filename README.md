## Overview

Short Description of Topic
The FT-86 is a model developed in Toyota and Subaru partnership. The vehcile is called the FT-86 because its development code of this vehicle is 086A. Its main production name is 86, which is pronounced "eight-six" or Hachi-Roku in Japanese, but more commonly GT86.

The Ft-86 inspired by and reference historic Toyota front-engined and rear-wheel drive sports coupés and hatchbacks, in the form of:

the 1967 2000GT (Japan's seminal fastback coupé whose design cues adorn the 86 and which was also powered by a 2.0-litre engine); and
the 1983 to 1987 AE86 range (renowned for its handling and drifting abilities).
Toyota also referenced to its first sports car, the Sports 800, given that both this car and the 86 share a boxer engine layout,[5] as widely used by project partner and 86 manufacturer, Subaru.

The Toyota 86 is a series of 2+2 seater sports cars jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru and solely manufactured by Subaru. It features a boxer engine, front engine, rear wheel drive drivetrain, 2+2 seating and a fastback coupé body style.

It is sold worldwide under three different brands with respective model names:

Toyota 86 in Asia, South Africa, North America (from August 2016), South America and Australia;[1] GT86 in Europe; both of the preceding names in New Zealand; FT86 in Nicaragua and Jamaica;
Subaru BRZ worldwide;
Scion FR-S in the US and Canada. After the Scion brand was discontinued in August 2016, the FR-S was renamed as the Toyota 86.[2][3]
